    <h3>House Blend Coffee</h3>
    <img src="./images/inside images/coffee-1030971_640.jpg" width="420"  alt="coffee image">
    <p>Itâ€™s deceptively simple. A blend of fine Latin American beans roasted to a glistening, dark chestnut color. Loaded with
    flavor, balancing tastes of nut and cocoa, just a touch of sweetness from the roast. This coffee is our beginning, the
    very first blend we ever created for you back in 1971. A true reflection of us and a delicious cup of coffee, period.</p>

    <h3>French Rost</h3>

    <p>French roast coffee is one of many coffee roasts named for a regional roasting style. It was popular throughout much of
    Europe around the turn of the 19th century. Today, the term is used most often when describing almost any dark-roasted
    coffee.
    
    Sometimes, French roast coffee is also referred to (colorfully) as Turkish roast, (incorrectly) as Espresso roast, or
    (simplistically) as Dark roast.
    
    
    Trivia Time: Other regional roasts include New England roast coffee, Spanish roast coffee, Italian roast coffee,
    American roast coffee, and Vienna roast coffee.</p>

    <h3>Colombian Rost</h3>
    <img src="./images/inside images/coffee-983955_640.jpg" width="420" alt="coffee images">
    <p>Our French Roast Colombian Coffee is full bodied with rich caramelized sugars, low acidity and with a robust bittersweet
    finish. We roast to the second crack, allowing natural oils to excrete, creating a shiny dark bean with a light oily
    surface. Developing a rich bold pleasing flavor of a dark roasted coffee without an overly bitter or charred tastes.</p>
